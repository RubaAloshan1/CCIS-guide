# College of Computer and Information Science Navigation Software

The Female student sector in the College of Computer Science and Information (CCSI) at Imam Muhammad ibn Saud University has a large building that can be difficult to navigate. To address this issue, we have developed a web-based software that provides students with quick and easy access to specific destinations within the college.

## Features and Benefits

Our navigation software is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing students to easily find their way around the building. Some of the key features and benefits of our software include:

- Quick and easy access to specific destinations within the college
- User-friendly interface that is easy to navigate
- Up-to-date and accurate information about the college building
- Saves students time and reduces frustration when navigating the building

## How It Works

To access the software, students simply need to scan the QR code for the website. Once they have accessed the website, they can search for specific destinations within the college, view a map of the building, and get directions to their desired location.

## How to Use the Software

Using our navigation software is easy. Here are the basic steps:

1. Scan the QR code for the website using your smartphone or other mobile device.
2. Once you have accessed the website, you can search for specific destinations within the college by typing in the name of the location or selecting it from a list.
3. You can also view a map showing multiple offices in each floor.
4. Once you have selected your desired location, the software will provide you with directions to help you get there.

## Limitations and Known Issues

While our navigation software is designed to be comprehensive and accurate, there may be some areas of the building that are not covered or that have limited information. Additionally, users may need to have a smartphone or other mobile device with a camera and internet access in order to use the software effectively.
